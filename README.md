# mmx-node

MMX is a blockchain written from scratch, using proven logic from Chia's Proof of Space and improved SHA256 VDF similar to Solana.

Main features:
- High performance code (1000 transactions per second or more)
- Custom high-level VM for smart contracts (similar to JavaScript)
- Variable supply (block reward scales with netspace, but also capped by TX fees)
- Consistent block times (created every 8 seconds)
- Native token and NFT support (atomic swaps with standard transactions)
- Non-interactive offers for off- and on-chain trading (like in Chia)
- Energy efficient Proof of Space (same as Chia)
- Standard ECDSA signatures for seamless integration (same as Bitcoin)

MMX is designed to be a blockchain that can be used as an actual currency.

Variable supply will stabilize the price, one of the key properties of any currency.

Thanks to an efficient implementation, it will provide low transaction fees, even at high throughput.

Launch of incentivized testnet planned for Oct2022, until ready for mainnet. Currently _testnet6_ is running. Coins farmed on testnet6 are _not worth anything_, now or later. Future incentivized testnet coins, with lower minimum reward, will carry over to mainnet.
